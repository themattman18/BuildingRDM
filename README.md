## Intro

As you may have found out, the documentation for building the Redis Desktop Manager isn't great.  These instructions will (hopefully) allow you to build the project from source and distribute it to your team members.

These directions work for the 2019.5 version of the Redis Desktop Manager
These directions are for building and installing RDM on Windows

## Step 1 - RDM documentation
Follow the directions located [here.](http://docs.redisdesktop.com/en/latest/install/#build-from-source)

If you can't get a successful build following these directions then there isn't any point in continuing on to the next step.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/themattman18/BuildingRDM/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/themattman18/BuildingRDM/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
